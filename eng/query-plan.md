# Query Plan

## Introduction
This example demonstrates how to use the system to complete a DeepResearch-type application, where answers are completely based on real information from all pages actually viewed, with clear citations. It also serves as a concrete demonstration of "functions as first-class citizens" by decomposing complex tasks into reusable tool functions.

## Plan-Act Enhanced Mode

### Description
This example uses enhanced plan-act to implement enhanced research search, demonstrating how to complete complex research tasks through function composition

### Specific Steps

#### Part 1: Publish a function to get detailed information from a single page

**Step 1** Enter Plan-Act planning mode
- On the homepage, click the plan-act planning mode button in the bottom right corner of the system
- A new box "Plan-act plan template" will appear on the left

**Step 2** Create new plan
- Click "New Plan" button

**Step 3** Configure plan template
- Click "Add first step"
- Enter the following information in sequence:
  - **Plan template name**: `Get current page information and answer questions`
  - **Task requirements**:
    ```
    First open <<Website URL>>
    Get its getText content and markdown content.
    Then, from the content, get content related to user question: <<User Question>> and return, including all obtained facts and data.
    You only need to access the current page, no need to expand to access sub-pages.
    ```
  - **Task output requirements**: `User question, Answer to question, Key evidence`

**Step 4** Select tools
- Click "Add/Remove Tools" button
- Select `browser_use` tool

**Step 5** Save plan
- Click "save" button
- Wait for "Save successful" prompt

**Step 6** Publish as tool service
- Select "Publish as Tool Service"
- Fill in the following information in sequence:
  - **Tool Name**: `Get current page information and answer questions`
  - **Tool Description**: `This tool can rely on website URL and user questions to access the website to answer user questions`
  - **Service Group**: `Research Query`
  - **Parameter Configuration**:
    - `Website URL`: URL address of the website to be accessed, must be complete URL e.g. https:url.com/subhtml
    - `User Question`: Specific question to be answered based on the website
- Select "Publish as Internal Tool Call"
- Confirm successful publication

#### Part 2: Publish a method to get research URLs from Baidu

**Step 7** Create second plan
- On the homepage, click the plan-act planning mode button again
- Click "New Plan" button

**Step 8** Configure second plan template
- Click "Add first step"
- Enter the following information in sequence:
  - **Plan template name**: `Get research URL information from Baidu`
  - **Task requirements**:
    ```
    First open Baidu search engine
    Organize all links related to user question: <<User Question>>
    Get the first 5 related links from the first page of search results through getMarkdown and getText methods respectively.

    Then use the "Get current page information and answer questions" tool to access each link to get answers.
    ```
  - **Task output requirements**: `User question, Answer to question, Key evidence`

**Step 9** Select tools
- Click "Add/Remove Tools" button
- Select the following tools:
  - `Get current page information and answer questions` tool (just created)
  - `browser_use` tool

**Step 10** Save and execute plan
- Click "save" button
- Select "Execute Plan"

## Expected Results
- Successfully publish two reusable tool functions
- First function can get detailed information from a single page and answer questions
- Second function can get related URLs from Baidu search and conduct deep research
- Implement complex research search functionality through function composition
- All answers are based on real content from actually accessed pages with clear citations

## Technical Points
- Functions as first-class citizens design philosophy
- Tool function publication and reuse
- Complex task decomposition and composition
- Deep research implementation methods
- Answer generation based on real data
- Clear presentation of citations and evidence
