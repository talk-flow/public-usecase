# AI Novel

## Introduction
This example demonstrates how to use the system to complete long-form content generation. Long-form content generation is generally limited by the system's context word count. Therefore, we need to leverage the Agent's divide-and-conquer capabilities to complete it in segments. This example demonstrates how to complete coherent long-form content by decomposing complex long-form creation tasks into manageable chapters, achieving intelligent content generation.

## Plan-Act Enhanced Mode
